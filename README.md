<h1>Irfan Ullah</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Irfan and this is my github page.</p>
<p>I started leaning coding just before the pandemic and ever since have tried learning and expanding my reach.</p>
<h3 align = middle>Some languages I know include:</h3>
<h5 align = middle>Python</h5> 
<h5 align = middle> HTML</h5>
<h5 align = middle>Javascript</h5>
<p>I also want to learn some css and maybe one of the c languages. Possible some assembly once I get a firm grasp on the previously stated languages.</p>
<p>Right now  I only know the basics of the languages listed above, but I hope to better myself and eventually make big projects using them.</p>
